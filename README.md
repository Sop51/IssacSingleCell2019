Single Cell Zebrafish Liver RNA-Sequence Data Analysis

Dropseq single cell RNA-seq data set from regenerating zebrafish livers. 
Adult male fish were treated with MTZ to cause liver injury. 
Sequencing was done at six different timepoints throughout the regeneration process. There is one sampe per timepoint, no replicates.
